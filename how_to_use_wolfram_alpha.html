    <h1>How to use <a href="https://www.wolframalpha.com/" target="_blank">WolframAlpha</a> | <a href="" target="_blank">Topic Playlist</a></h1>
	<p>A lot of students don't realize this, but WolframAlpha can be used to <b>check</b> your work on maths homework. I say <b>check</b> because you don't want to use WolframAlpha to do your homework for you. If students don't actually do the homework themselves, those students tend to do very badly on exams because they didn't practice by doing the homework. Copying answers from anywhere will complete the assignment but you won't retain much for the exam. Despite homework counting for around 10% of the course usually, about 90% of learning happens when doing the homework. Don't sabotage yourself by not doing your homework.</p>
	
	<p>WolframAlpha can do a lot a common problems if you know how to type the problem in correctly. One major difficulty is WolframAlpha will try to simplify the answer in a way a person would not, making the result significantly different from what a person would write. Also, complicated problems can exceed the free computation time limit and you may not get an answer. You can get around this by paying for a subscription, which also tries to provide step by step solutions, but the steps can be counter intuitive sometimes. However, the free version of WolframAlpha is often good enough.</p>
	
	<h3>Example 1 | <a href="" target="_blank">Explanation Video</a></h3>
	<div class="example_solution">
	<p>WolframAlpha can do general differentiation.</p>
	<p>This is a <a href="https://www.wolframalpha.com/input?i=derivative+of+x%5E4+sin%28x%29+e%5Ex+with+respect+to+x" target="_blank">WolframAlpha</a> link with the following input.</p>
	<pre>derivative of x^4 sin(x) e^x with respect to x</pre>
	\begin{equation}
	\frac{\text{d}}{\text{d}x} (x^{4} \sin(x) e^{x}) = e^{x} x^{3} ((x + 4) \sin(x) + x \cos(x))
	\end{equation}
	<p>The output is correct, but is simplified more than a person normally would.</p>
	</div>
	
	<p>The above differential equation is called a <b>separable equation</b> because we were able to separate the $x$ and $y$ variables on different sides of the equation, including the $\text{d}y$ and $\text{d}x$.</p>
	
	<p>Not all differential equation are <b>separable equation</b>. The below differential equation is not separable.</p>
	
	<h3>Example 2 | <a href="" target="_blank">Solution Video</a></h3>
	<div class="example_solution">
	<p>Determine if this ODE is a separable differential equation and why.</p>
	\begin{equation}
	x+y = \frac{\text{d}y}{\text{d}x}
	\end{equation}
	<p>First try multiplying both sides of the equation by $\text{d}x$.</p>
	\begin{equation}
	x \text{ d}x + y \text{ d}x = \text{d}y
	\end{equation}
	<p>The differential equation is not separable because the $y \text{ d}x$ term has both $x$ and $y$ in it. Dividing the entire equation by $y$ or $\text{d}x$ would just make one of the other terms mixed.</p>
	</div>
	
	<p>This method only works with first order differential equations. Sometimes the differential equation doesn't look separable but there's a trick to separate the variable, like a trig identity or factoring a polynomial into two parts with $x$ $y$ seprate.</p>
	
	<p>Try the following examples on your own.</p>
	
	<h3>Example 3 | <a href="" target="_blank">Solution Video</a></h3>
	<div class="example_solution">
	<p>Determine if this ODE is a separable differential equation. If yes, find the general solution.</p>
	\begin{equation}
	xy = \frac{\text{d}y}{\text{d}x}
	\end{equation}
	</div>
	
	<h3>Example 4 | <a href="" target="_blank">Solution Video</a></h3>
	<div class="example_solution">
	<p>Determine if this ODE is a separable differential equation. If yes, find the general solution.</p>
	\begin{equation}
	\frac{x}{y} = \frac{\text{d}y}{\text{d}x}
	\end{equation}
	</div>
	
	<h3>Example 5 | <a href="" target="_blank">Solution Video</a></h3>
	<div class="example_solution">
	<p>Determine if this ODE is a separable differential equation. If yes, find the general solution. (Warning: This will be an <b>implicit</b> solution.)</p>
	\begin{equation}
	\frac{\cos(x)}{9y^{8}+1} = \frac{\text{d}y}{\text{d}x}
	\end{equation}
	</div>
	
	<h3>Example 6 | <a href="" target="_blank">Solution Video</a></h3>
	<div class="example_solution">
	<p>Determine if this ODE is a separable differential equation. If yes, find the general solution. (Hint: Factor the LHS.)</p>
	\begin{equation}
	xy+y-x-1 = \frac{\text{d}y}{\text{d}x}
	\end{equation}
	</div>
	
	<p>You might remember that $\displaystyle \frac{\text{d}y}{\text{d}x}$ isn't a fraction, but treating $y'$ like a fraction in this case does. What's really going on goes back to implicit differention.</p>
	
	<h3>Why does treating $\displaystyle \frac{\text{d}y}{\text{d}x}$ like a fraction work? | <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqmicNYaJXI" target="_blank">Explanation Video</a></h3>
	<div class="theory">
	<p>A first order differential equation is separable if it can be rewritten into the below form.</p>
	\begin{equation}
	h(y)y' = g(x)
	\end{equation}
	<p>Taking the integral with respect to $x$ on the LHS and RHS absorbs the $y'$ into $H(y)$, where $H(y)$ and $G(x)$ are the antiderivatives of $h(y)$ and $g(x)$.</p>
	\begin{equation}
	\int h(y)y' \text{ d}x = \int g(x) \text{ d}x \qquad\qquad H(y) = G(x)
	\end{equation}
	<p>This is easier to see if $y$ is explicitly written as a function $y(x)$ and taking the derivative of the previous equation with respect to $x$.</p>
	\begin{equation}
	H\big(y(x)\big) = G(x) \qquad\qquad \frac{\text{d}}{\text{d}x} H\big(y(x)\big) = \frac{\text{d}}{\text{d}x} G(x) \qquad\qquad H'\big(y(x)\big)y'(x) = G'(x) \qquad\qquad h\big(y(x)\big)y'(x) = g(x)
	\end{equation}
	<p>The $y'(x)$ appears from the chain rule applied to $H\big(y(x)\big)$. So really the integration is with respect to $x$ on both sides of the equation, but treating the $\displaystyle y'=\frac{\text{d}y}{\text{d}x}$ as a fraction for serparting $x$ and $y$ to oppsites sides of the equation works and is notationally convenient.</p>
