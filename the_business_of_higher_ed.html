Lost City of Atlantis University

human computer job

petroleum engineers
  wating tables
  huge salaries because small hiring pool and huge demand from fracking

godel
  theorem
  cannibal god
  geometry 5th postulate

weeder courses
 cs vs chem
  college wants all the students
  majors only want the good students
  premed time courses so you can't fail one and stay on schedule

universities need money
 history department goes out of their way to advertise "all the thing you can do with a history degree"
 engineering departments don't because everyone knows it's useful

exploitive advisors
 graduate bad students early
 keep good students longer
  universities increase cost in year 7
 tenure track professors are safest because they have a vested interest in students publishing and graduating
  tenure track is 6 years long and there's no second chances, find a new university of go into industry
 tenured professors can be good or bad
  some like advising and want their students to succeed
  some just use students as a way to get funding
  some give more risky research to students that need publications to graduate
look up previous grad students
 use professors publications if not on website
 BS and MS/PhD  graduation date to length
 was their career outcome good (useful skill, professor well connected, university ties to industry)

university of community college first
 community college is cheaper
 can buy your way inot university if your community college grades won't be good enough

should you get an MS of PhD
 yes if you want to work in a country that you are not a citizen of
 company must hire citizen meeting minimum requirements over non citizen
  easy to get around by posting job description no one qualifies for, picking interviewee, make a new job posting for their resume
 companies can pay non citizens less because they want to live in the country and there's a lot of competition

academia is a bad idea
 adjunct lecturer perpetually switching universities
 rate of new PhDs, fraction that go into academia, rate of new positions/retiring

cutting tuition
 50% / 50% students / state halve enrollment
 garnished wages for job in field of study
 the system we have now

vocational schools
 some engineers don't want to use tools
 electrician, plumber, concrete, drywall

your coursework will be similar to your job but more tedious
 a lot of poeple get degree but eventually choose to not have a job related to their degree

curved course sequence
 bad professor and great professor for first course in sequence
 second course average professor
 expect a split bell curve

adjunct lecturers tend to grade easiest
tenured tend to grade the hardest

key to secure employment is being able to do a job that few people can do / few people want to do
 actuary, tramatic content moderator, AI

statistics is far more valuable in every day life than calculus
 government policy, medicine, education
