	  <p>Higher Education is a business. And like a business, Higher Education is trying to sell you something. As the old adage goes, <b>"You can never trust a person that <i>needs</i> something from you."</b> It's in a university's best interest to convince prospective students that paying their tuition is a good investment. But not just the university, individual majors are also fighting for a limited number of enrolled students. While they don't outright lie due to the consequences, there's a lot of misleading and omitted information in their promotions.</p>
    
    <p>Even so, there are some things prospective students can look out for when picking a university or major or graduate advisor. That includes if you'll like the jobs your degree is applicable to. For instance, the first job of many STEM graduates is not in STEM. There are multiple reasons for this, but one reason is STEM graduates didn't really like what they had studied, and the reality of doing what you studied forever in a STEM career is unappealing, so they got a non-STEM job after graduation.</p>
    
    <h2 id="recorded_lectures">Picking a Grad Advisor | <a href="" target="_blank"><img class="inline_youtube_icon" alt="youtube icon" src="images/youtube_icon.svg"> Video</a></h2>
    <p>Not all advisors are equal. Some are better at mentoring than others. Some are not well connected when you graduate. Some care about your wellbeing, while other do not.</p>
    
    <p>Knowing the path from undergrad to tenured professor helps to understand why grad advisors can be exploitive.</p>
    
    <p>At the end of a PhD program, the doctor has learned how to complete and publish novel research. Next is the postdoc, where a PhD graduate typically goes to another university and continues to publish for two to three years. Your quantity and quality of publications during your postdoc determines which universities you will be accepted for a tenure track position. The tenure process lasts around six years, with some updates to let you know if you're on track to get tenure. If you fail to get tenure, the options are start over at another university or leave academia.</p>
    
    <p>There are a few types of grad advisors. One is in the process of getting tenure, another prioritizes graduating students, and another cares about research.</p>
    
    <h2 id="recorded_lectures">Recorded Lectures | <a href="" target="_blank"><img class="inline_youtube_icon" alt="youtube icon" src="images/youtube_icon.svg"> Video</a></h2>
    <p>What if instead of in person lecturers, many of your courses had recorded lectures?</p>
    
    universities need money
 not in universities best interest to record basic lectures
 could have just one lecturer for he whole country
 averages the cost of courses with fewer students using the courses with hundreds of students
    
    <p>Some students would not like this, many wouldn't care, and others would love it.</p>
    
    <p>The courses with large enrollment averages the tuition per course with all the smaller enrollment courses.</p>
    
    
    <h2 id="curved_grading">Curved Grading | <a href="" target="_blank"><img class="inline_youtube_icon" alt="youtube icon" src="images/youtube_icon.svg"> Video</a></h2>
    <p>Curved grading is actually very beneficial for lecturers by obscuring their teaching ability.</p>
    
    curved course sequence
 bad professor and great professor for first course in sequence
 second course average professor
 expect a split bell curve
    
    <p>For simplicity, lets look at a first course in a sequence, like calculus or chemistry or physics, in the fall term that has 250 students in the course. The expectation is the backgrounds and capabilities of this group of 250 students should be random and as a result, the grade distribution will be a bell curve.</p>
    
    <p>Did you know that some universities used to have shared final exams for courses with multiple sections, such three separate courses of Calculus I offered in the same term with three different lecturers? </p>
    
    
    
    <p>Here's an exam which has a bimodal grade distribution, which is fancy for two spikes.</p>
    <p>This wasn't from half the students being competent and the rest being incompetent. It turned out that the lecturer had assumed all the students learned something from a previous course because the lecturers decided to teach different things.</p>
    
    <p>The lecturer decided to not count the exam in the grade, but this could have been prevented with more standardization of the prerequisite course.</p>
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    Lost City of Atlantis University
     history department goes out of their way to advertise "all the thing you can do with a history degree"
     engineering departments don't because everyone knows it's useful
     
     look up the outcomes of students that recently graduated in your major
      what is the job people have a few months after graduation from your school, what about a year later, did they switch careers or ever get a job in their field of study
      for some majors, there can be thousands of graduates each year, in that case look at the career outcomes of students with graduate degrees, if the MS PhD graduates are having trouble finding a job, BS students are much worse off
      contact people on LinkedIn for their advice, most people like talking about themselves, give a candid review, I've done well but I'm one of the lucky ones
      actuary study vs reality
     
     outcome varies based on university
      proximity to employers like Stanford Silicon Valley computer science and ULCA Hollywood entertainment industry
      universities can have stronger ties to employers because of their proximity
      
     your coursework will be similar to your job but more tedious
      a lot of people get degree but eventually choose to not have a job related to their degree

Lost City of Atlantis University

human computer job

petroleum engineers
  waiting tables
  huge salaries because small hiring pool and huge demand from fracking

godel
  theorem
  cannibal god
  geometry 5th postulate

weeder courses
 cs vs chem
  college wants all the students
  majors only want the good students
  premed time courses so you can't fail one and stay on schedule

big vs large company
 smaller companies you work on a greater variety of stuff, larger companies more specialized
 google button color team

exploitive advisors
 graduate bad students early
 keep good students longer
  universities increase cost in year 7
 tenure track professors are safest because they have a vested interest in students publishing and graduating
  tenure track is 6 years long and there's no second chances, find a new university of go into industry
 tenured professors can be good or bad
  some like advising and want their students to succeed
  some just use students as a way to get funding
  some give more risky research to students that need publications to graduate
look up previous grad students
 use professors publications if not on website
 BS and MS/PhD  graduation date to length
 was their career outcome good (useful skill, professor well connected, university ties to industry)

university of community college first
 community college is cheaper
 can buy your way inot university if your community college grades won't be good enough

should you get an MS of PhD
 yes if you want to work in a country that you are not a citizen of
 company must hire citizen meeting minimum requirements over non citizen
  easy to get around by posting job description no one qualifies for, picking interviewee, make a new job posting for their resume
 companies can pay non citizens less because they want to live in the country and there's a lot of competition
 exceptions like electrical engineering since there's so much to knows
 chemistry where you specialize in something

academia is a bad idea
 adjunct lecturer perpetually switching universities
 rate of new PhDs, fraction that go into academia, rate of new positions/retiring

cutting tuition
 50% / 50% students / state halve enrollment
 garnished wages for job in field of study
 the system we have now

vocational schools
 some engineers don't want to use tools
 electrician, plumber, concrete, drywall





adjunct lecturers tend to grade easiest
tenured tend to grade the hardest

key to secure employment is being able to do a job that few people can do / few people want to do
 actuary, tramatic content moderator, AI

statistics is far more valuable in every day life than calculus
 government policy, medicine, education
